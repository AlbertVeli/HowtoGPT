Simple openai chatcompletion python script based on https://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?lang=en&id=771

$ ./howtogpt.py -h

Usage: ./howtogpt.py [-h] [-r] [-m <system>] <question>

  Use -m raw (or -r) for a raw question or
  the name of any system for a cmdline.
  Default value is "ubuntu".

  EXAMPLES

  $ ./howtogpt.py reverse lines in one file
  tac <filename>

  $ ./howtogpt.py -m powershell reverse lines in one file
  Get-Content -Path "file.txt" | Select-Object -Reverse | Set-Content -Path "reversed.txt"

  $ ./howtogpt.py -r describe the gecos field in a unix password file
  The GECOS field in a Unix password file contains general information about a user. It
  typically includes the user's full name, contact information, office location, and
  other optional details. This field is primarily used for administrative purposes and
  may vary depending on the Unix system in use.

  # Create symlink to howtogpt.py in ~/bin
  $ cd ~/bin
  $ ln -s <path to howtogpt.py> howto
  # Make sure ~/bin is in $PATH
  $ echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep $HOME
  /home/albert/bin

  # now howto can be run from any directory
  $ howto convert heic image to png
  heif-convert image.heic image.png

  $ howto -r what are the fundamental axioms in mathematical proofs
  The fundamental axioms vary depending on the branch of mathematics. However, some common axioms include:

  1. Peano axioms: These axioms define the properties of natural numbers, such as the existence of zero, successor function, and induction principle.
  2. Euclidean axioms: These axioms describe the properties of plane geometry, including the existence of points, lines, and angles.
  3. Field axioms: These axioms define the properties of arithmetic operations and algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields.
  4. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory axioms: These axioms provide a foundation for set theory, including principles of existence, extensionality, and power sets.
  5. Continuum axioms: These axioms describe properties of real numbers, including completeness and the least upper bound property.


LICENSE

The openai examples use the MIT license and this is basically an openai example with some
cmdline flag parsing so it feels appropriate to use the same.

$ ./howtogpt.py -r Can you generate an MIT license text for a project named HowtoGPT?
