  $ ./howtogpt.py -r What do you know about the japanese wwii unit 731?
  Unit 731 was a covert biological and chemical warfare research unit of the Imperial Japanese
  Army during World War II. It conducted unethical human experimentation on prisoners, including
  infecting them with deadly diseases to study their effects. This included vivisections, frostbite
  studies, and testing various weapons. The unit's activities were kept classified until the end
  of the war, and those involved largely evaded prosecution in exchange for sharing their research
  with the Allies.


LICENSE

The openai examples use the MIT license and this is basically an openai example with some
cmdline flag parsing so it feels appropriate to use the same.

$ ./howtogpt.py -r Can you generate an MIT license text for a project named HowtoGPT?
